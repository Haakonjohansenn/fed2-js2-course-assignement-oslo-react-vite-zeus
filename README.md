# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Report FED2-Javascript 2 Course Assignment

### Intro


### Login/Register page - Sander Selfors

My part of this assignment was creating an efficient and user-friendly registration and login system for our social media platform using JavaScript and React.

For the registration form, I incorporated a strict email validation process that specifically checked if the user's email belonged to the domains "@noroff.no" or "@stud.noroff.no". If the email didn't match these criteria, I made sure to display a helpful error message. Upon successful registration, users were greeted with a warm welcome message and automatically redirected to the login page.

Moving on to the login form, I ensured a smooth login experience by sending the user's credentials to the server for verification. If the login was successful, I stored the access token in the local storage for future use. Error handling was also a crucial part, and I made sure to display clear error messages to assist users in case of any issues.

Furthermore, I paid special attention to responsive design, making the forms adaptable to various screen sizes for enhanced user interaction. Working alongside my fellow student, Ali and Espen, greatly contributed to my learning journey, making this project a significant milestone in my mastery of JavaScript, React, and web development.
